# Page view time series visualizer

For this project I visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. 

The project was made during the course [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/#data-analysis-with-python-projects) 
of [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

* **Python libraries:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib. 
* **Data source:** [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).
